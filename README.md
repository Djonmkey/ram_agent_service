RAM Agent Service (RAS) is an agentic platform developed by RAM Software for orchestrating and executing autonomous AI agents that integrate deeply with business systems and workflows. RAS supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to manage structured inputs and actions, utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for dynamic, real-time knowledge access, and enables scalable inference pipelines for context-aware decision-making. Designed for modularity and control, RAS empowers teams to build and manage intelligent agents that adapt to complex environments and deliver high-leverage automation.
